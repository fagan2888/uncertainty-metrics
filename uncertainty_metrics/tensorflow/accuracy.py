"""Oracle Collaborative Accuracy measures for probabilistic predictions.

Oracle Collaborative Accuracy measures the usefulness of model uncertainty
scores in facilitating human-computer collaboration (e.g., between a neural
model and an "oracle" human moderator in moderating online toxic comments).

The idea is that given a large amount of testing examples, the model will first
generate predictions for all examples, and then send a certain percentage of
examples that it is not confident about to the human moderators, whom we assume
can label those examples correctly.

The goal of this metric is to understand, under capacity constraints on the
human moderator (e.g., the model is only allowed to send 0.1% of total examples
to humans), how well the model can collaborate with the human to achieve the
highest overall accuracy. In this way, the metric attempts to quantify the
behavior of the full model-moderator system rather than of the model alone.

A model that collaborates with a human oracle well should not be accurate, but
also capable of quantifying its uncertainty well (i.e., its uncertainty should
be calibrated such that uncertainty ≅ model accuracy).
